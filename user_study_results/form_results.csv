Also, there is only one attribtuion that I have found on any site for this painting - Titian, so none is most authoritative",2 Disagree,16:57,16:59,5 Strongly agree,5 Strongly agree,5 Strongly agree,the source or the criteria underpinning the attribution are the most reliable;the cited scholar or source of information is considered authoritative (i.e. s/he an high h index);the cited scholar or source of information is often cited wrt the artist (acceptance rating),"There are no alternative attributions for this painting, so its not a good example.",2 Disagree,3 Neither agree nor disagree,3 Neither agree nor disagree,the source or the criteria underpinning the attribution are the most reliable;the cited scholar or source of information is considered authoritative (i.e. s/he an high h index);the cited scholar or source of information is often cited wrt the artist (acceptance rating),3 Neither agree nor disagree,"I don't understand the H index - you've attributed a 2 to E. Fahy and a 32 to Berenson.  Not sure why, and how would I know 2 is higher.  Also why is Fahy higher than Berenson?

I still don't understand why Berenson gets a 32.  Then Christie's gets a 4?  I don't understand the ranking criteria I guess.....  As an art historian, I'd have to know how you ranked the authorities.  Do i trust you as the designer?  Assuming I did, then the system works well.  But as an art historian, that is my first question...."
